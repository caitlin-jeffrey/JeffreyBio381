Second          More Text   1.555555  2.2220
Third           x           3         124

To:
First String,Second,1.22,3.4
Second,More Text,1.555555,2.2220
Third,x,3,124

FIND: [ \t]{2,} #finds two or more adjacent spaces within a line

REPLACE: , #replaces these multiple spaces with a comma
```

###2. Question two:

```
Go from:
Ballif, Bryan, University of Vermont
Ellison, Aaron, Harvard Forest
Record, Sydne, Bryn Mawr

To:
Bryan Ballif (University of Vermont)
Aaron Ellison (Harvard Forest)
Sydne Record (Bryn Mawr)

FIND: (\w+),\s*(\w+),\s*(\w+\s\w.*).* #chops up the line into 3 different captures

REPLACE: \2 \1 \(\3\) #rearranges the three captures and puts in parantheses

```

###3. Question three:

```
Go from:
0001 Georgia Horseshoe.mp3 0002 Billy In The Lowground.mp3 0003 Cherokee Shuffle.mp3 0004 Walking Cane.mp3

To:
0001 Georgia Horseshoe.mp3
0002 Billy In The Lowground.mp3
0003 Cherokee Shuffle.mp3
0004 Walking Cane.mp3

FIND: (\.mp3 ) #captures the end of what we want for each line

REPLACE: \1\r #after each capture, creates a line break 
```

###4. Question four:

```
Go from:
0001 Georgia Horseshoe.mp3
0002 Billy In The Lowground.mp3
0003 Cherokee Shuffle.mp3
0004 Walking Cane.mp3

To:
Georgia Horseshoe_0001.mp3
Billy In The Lowground_0002.mp3
Cherokee Shuffle_0003.mp3
Walking Cane_0004.mp3

FIND: ([0-9]{4})\s(\w+.*)(\.mp3 ) #chops up the line into 3 different captures

REPLACE: \2_\1\3 #moves first capture (4-digit code) second, puts in an underscore before third capture 
```


###5. Question five:

```
Go from:
Camponotus,pennsylvanicus,10.2,44
Camponotus,herculeanus,10.5,3

To:
C_pennsylvanicus,44
C_herculeanus,3
M_punctiventris,4
L_neoniger,55

FIND: (\w)\w+,(\w+),(\d*\.\d),(\d+) #chops up the line into 4 different captures, only taking first letter of genus

REPLACE: \1_\2,\4 #takes first letter of genus (first capture), then puts an underscore, second capture (first four of species) and inserts the last number (fourth capture)
```

###6. Question six:

```
Go from:
Camponotus,pennsylvanicus,10.2,44
Camponotus,herculeanus,10.5,3
Myrmica,punctiventris,12.2,4
Lasius,neoniger,3.3,55

To:
C_penn,44
C_herc,3
M_punc,4
L_neon,55

FIND: (\w)\w+,(\w{4})\w+,(\d*\.\d),(\d+) #chops up the line into 4 different captures, only taking first letter of genus and second capture is only first four letters of species

REPLACE: \1_\2,\4 #takes first letter of genus (first capture), then puts an underscore, second capture (first 4 of species) and inserts the last number (fourth capture)
```

###7. Question seven:

```
Go from:

Lasneo, 55, 3.3

FIND: (\w{3})\w+,(\w{3})\w+,(\d*\.\d),(\d+) #chops up the line into 4 different captures, only taking first 3 letters of genus and second capture is only first three letters of species

REPLACE: \1\2, \4, \3 #takes first 3 letters of genus (first capture) and combines with second capture (first 3 of species), inserts a comma, a space, the third capture with a comma and a space, and then the last number (fourth capture)
